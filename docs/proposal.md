# Movie + TV Review Website
## Overview
A website that would allow users to create a profile where they can add movies and tv shows to their profile with reviews and ratings that are publically visible. Users could also follow other users to see their reviews on a timeline, or possibly follow specific programs they're interested in.

## Competing Services

### [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/welcome) [1]
Letterboxd is a service promoting "grass-roots" film discussion. They allow users to rate and review movies but also maintain a diary where they can add movies they've seen and the date they saw them. However, it only offers movies in it's library, with few select limited-run television and/or streaming series being offered for users to discuss alongside movies.

In my opinion the largest flaw of Letterboxd is the lack of tv shows in their library. The site also clearly has a target audience in more niche or indie film crowds. I think my website could have a more broad appeal by listing tv shows and promoting more mainstream, popular programs.

### [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home) [2]
IMDb primarily operates as a database for information about movies and tv. Though the service allows users to post reviews, the focus seems to be on information such as cast & crew and promotional materials. They also offer trivia and other tangential information where available.

For my website I am less concerned with listing most of the informational material, such as promotional material. It may still be useful to display cast information and some images such as posters or thumbnails for the program for the sake of user experience.

### [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) [3]
Rotten Tomatoes, known for it's Tomatometer feature, lets users review movies and tv and dispalys a public audience score on individual pages. However, those pages are largely dedicated to curated certified critic reviews and the overall critic score which is the metric by which the Tomatometer "freshness" is determined.

In contrast to Rotten Tomatoes, I would like my website to cater more towards user reviews. For instance, instead of displaying a score or "freshness" based off of critic reviews it could instead be calculated by averaging user ratings.

## Languages, Frameworks, & Tools

### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) [4]
While TypeScript is not necessarily required by Angular, it is the popular (and default) choice when using the framework.
### [Angular](https://angular.io) [5]
Angular offers a very complete ecosystem for developing a web app. It provides a lot of built-in functionality through its libraries without the need for a second framework, such as Next.
### [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) [6]
The Movie Database offers an API for both movies and tv and has high rate limiting. There are even some open-source JavaScript libraries to simplify access.
