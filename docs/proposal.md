# Initial Idea
Personal Movie & TV Rating Catalogue
* A website that would allow users to create a profile where they can add movies and tv shows to their profile with reviews and ratings that are publically visible. Users could also follow other users to see their reviews on a timeline, or possibly follow specific programs they're interested in.

* Possible Competitors/Similar sites: Letterboxd, IMdB, The Movie Database, Rotten Tomatoes
