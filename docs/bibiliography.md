## Competing Services
1. [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/welcome), a primary source, is a website that lets users rate and review movies with few tv/streaming series available. It's a competing service in that it is a site for reviewing and discussing film. It has a very complete set of features for doing so as well. Beside rating and reviewing with a star system and a written review, users can mark films as watched and even maintain a diary for marking when they saw a film. It seems to cater to  the "film-buff" crowd showing off smaller, less mainstream movies on its homepage (though mainstream titles are available).

2. [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home), a primary source competing service, is large platform primarily focused on delivering information about movies and tv. They even offer an API through AWS to pull this information. There is much less of a focus on user reviews and discussion, though there are still options to do so.

3. [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/), a primary source, is a competing service for rating and reviewing programs. The site largely seems to cater towards professional critic reviews, which are used to determine the sites "Tomatometer" score feature. Other users can still leave reviews and an audience score is displayed but it feels much less important.

## Development Resources
1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), an alternate language to JavaScript with all of the same functionality and the addition of strong type system for data. Practically required by Angular.

2. [Angular](https://angular.io), a complete rewrite of AngularJS that is TypeScript-based which fffers many tools for web app development.

3. [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs), an API from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/), that offers a free service for retrieving information on movies & TV.

### Considered Development Resources 
1. [React](https://react.dev/), a JavaScript framework that allows for UI to be built out of individual, reusable components.

2. [Next](https://nextjs.org/), a framework that extends the functionality of JavaScript UI frameworks such as React.
