# Bibliography
### [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)
- Letterboxd does not offer TV shows (apart from select limited series) for users to review.
- Has a very non-mainstream heavy lineup on the homepage when using the site as an unregistered user.
- Offers a diary service for users to track what movies they've watched over the course of their memberships.
- Users can mark a movie as watched without having to leave a review.
- Users are able to add films to watchlists and share them on the site.
- Users can reply to each others reviews and comments in lieu of forums.
- Profiles display favorites as well recently reviewed films with an aside containing tangential information like score distribution and diary check-ins.

### [IMdB](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home)
- IMdB is both very information forward, with less focus on reviews. Things like cast, crew, and promotional material take predence over reviews and discussion.
- Profile are basic. The pages display user reviews in a timeline as well as showing recently viewed pages for programs.

### [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US)
- Follows a similar format to IMdB that puts production information above reviews though they seem more relevant than on IMdB.
- Offers individual forums for programs to create dedicated discussion posts.
- Can display rating information such as score distribution and how often the movie has been reviewed.
- User profiles are very limited. They show how many reviews someone has made and distribution of scores across the ratings as well as any watchlists they've created.

### [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
- Focuses more on showing professional critic reviews as opposed to user reviews. They exist on the site, but are just far more buried.
- User pages for critics display an associated publication, and a neat timeline of reviews containing ratings, title, and reviews in a timeline.
- User pages for non-critics shows curated watchlists as well what movies have been reviewed with a visible star rating, but the users written reviews are not visible.
